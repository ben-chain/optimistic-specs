# Optimistic Rollup Overview

TLDR: Push the optimistic-rollup state of the art by leveraging Ethereum Layer 1 tech on Layer 2. (Experimental, active R&D!)

## Goals

- 1:1 EVM
  - No special compiler
  - No unexpected gas cost
  - All tooling just works (configure different chain ID, that's it)
- 100% compatibility with Eth1 nodes
  - The Merge introduces an Engine API
    - Fork-choice: change head based on L1 reorgs of data (and leverage undisputed state-roots for finalized checkpoint)
    - Block-production: sequencing blocks with any Eth1 node
    - Block-insertion: Eth1 node has specialized EVM and DB, valuable for L2, instead of reinventing the wheel
  - Leverage sync: insert latest blocks from rollup node (pull from L1), but do state-sync via L2 p2p network
  - Leverage tx propagation (happy case, if not forcing tx via L1): L2 user sends transaction to any sequencer, via tx pool. Anyone can bond to be a sequencer
  - Fee model fit: EIP1559 on L2, on actual L2 block-capacity usage. (note: L2 gas-limit of blocks may adjust based on L1 data cost)

### L1 Contracts
- **Feeds**: "Data availability layer"--append-only logs (e.g. of deposits, transactions, and batched transactions) which must guarantee that:
  - all values and their witnesses are indexable by off-chain parties
  - witnesses are verifiable by on-chain dispute contract
- **State Oracle**: Cryptoeconomic light client of the L2.
  - *Contract separation is not yet final.  Highest priority interface spec: Single-step verification API* 
  - **Proposal Manager**: Handles conflicting state proposals to determine malicious party
    - Maintains a set of ongoing optimistic proposals of the L2 state
    - Ensures that state proposers are sufficiently bonded
    - Distributes bond payouts
  - **k-section game**
    - executed to narrow in on the first disagreed-upon step between proposers
    - played between two parties ("all people who agree with a proposal" may be considered a single party)
    - merkle tree of execution steps between the trusted start and disputed end
  - **Single Step Verifier** for executing the earliest disagreed-upon step
    - Loads witness data:
      - step witness parts can be represented as `generalized index -> bytes32`, 
        to simplify interaction with the partial structure (no tree management, every lookup is a simple math evaluation to get the right key)
      - involved contract code entries can be large, TBD if put in storage or better of in call-data
      - MPT nodes are just a dict (of internal MPT node hash to MPT node content)
    - Runs verification step
    - Registers result in bond-manager (slash sequencer, reward challenger, or vice-versa if spam attempt)
- **Cross-domain Messenger**: Message-passing abstraction contract used by applications developers (e.g. token bridge implementations)
    - Log authorized calls as forced L2 transactions (deposits)
    - Verify L2 data statelessly with MPT proof to undisputed state-root (withdrawals)

### L2 Components

- **Rollup Synchronizer** (previously "Data Transport Layer"):
  - Sync data from the L1: call payload-insertion method of Engine API
  - Track L1 data tip, and track state-roots: call forkchoice method of Engine API to finalize (undisputed state root) and reorg (follow head derived from L1)
  - Create execution payloads:
    - L2 Blocks as a whole from the L1 (i.e. include header data for batch of transactions) (TBD)
    - Follow rollup rules to batch remaining individual transactions
    - L1 may log special transactions, created by the Gateway,
      which are paid for (i.e. signed by dummy key, and sent to L2 Gateway receiver contract, avoid new transaction type)
  - Verifier (if loaded with a funded L1 account to bond the challenge):
    - Block is executed with engine API, resulting state root is cached
    - State roots are synced (maybe with a slight delay)
    - If roots are different, run the Fraud-Proof Generator and start challenger agent job
- **Execution Engine** (previously "Eth1 client")
  - Serves new [Engine API](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/consensus_api_design_space) (Work in progress, introduced in The Merge hardfork)
  - Maintains the L2 state (just like it would on L1)
  - Syncs state to other L2 nodes for fast onboarding. Engine API can inform of finalized checkpoint,
    to efficiently sync to trusted point, before processing block by block to the head of the L2 chain.
- **Witness Generator**:
  - Highly experimental concept implementation (work in progress!): [Macula](https://github.com/protolambda/macula)
  - Python: readability, not performance critical, just a temporary sub-process
  - Requires bare minimum API methods from the Engine:
    - get a MPT node (actually already present in p2p of eth1)
    - get contract-code by contract-code hash
  - Inputs:
    - the API address to call for MPT node data and contract code
    - the last 256 block-hashes
    - the failing execution payload
  - Output: fraud proof
    - array of `bytes32`, root of each step, in sequence. (can be thousands)
    - array of `AccessData`, encoding the set of generalized indices, code-hashes and MPT-node-hashes that were accessed this step.
      as well as for the step-by-index (optimization, see generator spec).
    - dict of `bytes32->(bytes32, bytes32)`: DB of all tree structure of the steps, without duplicating anything
    - dict of `bytes->bytes`: map MPT node key (not leaf key, the actual internal node hash referenced in parent MPT nodes) to MPT node (RLP encoded path and child node data)
    - dict of `bytes32->bytes`: map contract-code-hash to full contract code
    - metadata of fraud (when/where/etc.)
- **Challenger Agent**:
  - Take generated fraud proof (e.g. JSON file)
  - Submit bond: control spam, challenges get back the bond, if they are actually valid.
  - Run dispute game, retrieve disputed step index
    - every step before this is agreed on by both parties
    - the first differing step will be verified by reproducing the correct outcome on-chain
  - Build witness data:
     1. get root of the disputed step
     2. get generalized indices
     3. load nodes as identified by the AccessData from shared dicts
     4. format witness data as L1 transaction input
  - Sign tx, finish dispute (resubmit if not confirmed in time)
- **Batch Submitter**:
  - Finalizes pre-confirmed sequencer transactions onto L1
  - Writes to sequencer feed


## Caveats

- Undecided if the rollup will be committing to state-roots or block-roots, both have pros/cons
- MPT (Merkle Patricia Trie, storage layout of ethereum) is even more complex in this context,
  possible to translate into execution steps, but takes dev time
- Receipt trie and transaction trie in the block use MPT too, but do not need witness data, they are write-only
- Some precompiles are harder to implement, possible, but ignored for now
- Generator is essentially an EVM implementation, needs a lot of testing (leverage eth1 testing suite)
